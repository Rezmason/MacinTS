**...[Rez](https://www.rezmason.net), what are you doing?**

_What do you mean?_

**You're starting a project about writing [old Mac software](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/navigation/), which you've never done, using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which you've also never done.**

_There's nothing wrong with trying new things, FAQ question voice. Besides, TypeScript doesn't appear to be all that different from [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript), modern JavaScript and [Haxe](https://haxe.org/)._

**Nevertheless, don't you have too much stuff going on in your life to be trying whatever it is you're doing?**

_Mind your own damn business!_

**Well, it's a frequently asked question.**

_I have the right to just make an empty Github repo for a rough idea that randomly occurs to me._

**What's your goal here?**

_I want to implement the [Macintosh Toolbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Toolbox) in TypeScript. I'm imagining a classic Mac desktop in an HTML canvas, and an API that should allow web developers to make TS and JS apps that run in there. That might be kinda presumptuous. The whole point is to let folks experience classic Mac development without having to pick up the IDEs and programming languages of the time._

**How much of this is a Mac emulator?**

_None, I hope. There's plenty of [Mac emulators](https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php) out there, and [these](https://jamesfriend.com.au/pce-js/) [two](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_mac) are even on the web. MacinTS is more focused on personally discovering and recreating the mindset of the early Mac programmer, rather than virtualizing the old hardware. And if it turns out I'm being naive, no harm done._

**Is this to play Dark Castle?**

_This is to __make__ Dark Castles. In JavaScript._

**So what's your plan?**

_There are a couple Mac emulators that don't require ROMsâ€” those are the ones that theoretically implement the Macintosh Toolbox. I'll fork one or both of those, and get to work migrating the (likely C) implementations and tests to TypeScript. If the result looks promising, I'll make an example project and host it, and maybe create an installable TS/JS package or something._

**What makes you think anyone will be interested in this?**

_I'm interested. And I've had some success porting things before. Let's just see where this goes._

**All right. Is there a timetable or roadmap?**

_Not yet, no. This has zero priority. In fact that's the end of the FAQ until I know more._
